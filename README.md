# Latent Conditional GAN
This repository is to introduce PyTorch implementation of our paper: ["LCGAN: Conditional GAN with Multiple Discrete Classes"](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pjsai/JSAI2020/0/JSAI2020_2K4ES202/_article/-char/ja/)

## Introduction

This paper introduces Latent Conditional GAN. This is Conditional GAN whose label is generated by the latent code of Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE). Thanks to this kind of label representation, comparing to the one-hot vector, the model has advantages as follows:
- Reduction of the label dimension
- Inclusion of the class relevance
- Representing the continuous label by discrete classes
- *not depending on the structure of GANs and VAEs

I conducted the experimentation with CelebA dataset, which has plenty of annotations. As a result, this model could generate data that changes continuously in regard to the given class vector with a lower dimension.

## Notebook Structure
The whole picture of my model is shown below.

This procedure is divided into **3 notebooks** and they are colored separately. I'm gonna show the results and concise explanations, please visit the notebooks for the detail and the implementation.

#### VAE
The reconstructed images are shown below, where the upper images represent the input image and the others are reconstructed by the model. The reconstructed image seems to be distinguishable among the classes.

## Git LFS (large file storage)
Since this repository contains the parameters of VAE and LCGAN. I used Git LFS to store a large file. The codes below are the recipe for this.

```bash
brew update
brew install git-lfs
```
- then, navigate to this repository.
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull
```
